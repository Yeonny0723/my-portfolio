The reason I chose to change my career path as a developer was very simple. I watched an interview with programmer and was immediately captivated by programming looking at how powerful it is to be able to deliver values to the world! I switched my major without hesitation to Information systems and studied basic computer science/programming along with a IT strategic business process management I and was able to graduate with HD. I enjoy the entire problem-solving process and working as a team. Given that front-end engineer can observe immediate user reaction and feedback and the fast-paced changing trend environment, I am particularly interested in front-end engineering.    "
