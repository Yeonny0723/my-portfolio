### About Portfolio

Starting my developer study in 2020, I wanted to prove my fast-learning curve + potential + creativity through this portfolio.
As a non-cs student, I also wanted to appeal my algorithms and cs fundamentals and provide a compact overview of all the projects I've done so far. 

For the home page, I tried to make a page interactive and visually appealing with various animations and pictures. And I encoded all the welcome messages of each language I can speak into binary code and added a bit of fun point by visualizing them.  
Next for the profile page, I added the mac terminal view and describe myself using Python Object-oriented programming. On top of that, I would like to mention my favorite algorithm is the Greedy algorithm cuz I love the fact that it chooses the best option available at the moment, which is so close to my life motto!

### Used tools & libraries
React, i8next(multi-language), framer-motion, jest, react-dom, react-router-dom

### To do list (Future)
Too many rendering happens while clicking binary image at Home page -> Should optimize
Each image has different loading time at Portfolio page -> Bundle || SSR
Apply Typescript
